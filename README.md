# Discord Bot Templates
 In this repository you can find some templates that can get you started with creating your own Discord bot.<br>
 More detailed documentation can be found in a separate README for each template.<br>
 
 ## Contributing
 If you would like to add a template, feel free to fork this repository, add the template, and make a pull request. Make sure to include all the basics someone would need to get them started (like a command handler, connection to a database (preferably MongoDB) etc. - see the [TypeScript](https://github.com/Pandicon/Discord-Bot-Templates/tree/main/TypeScript) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/Pandicon/Discord-Bot-Templates/tree/main/JavaScript) template for how it should look).<br>
 If you feel like something could be coded better/nicer, you are free to make a pull request with the change. You might be more experienced with some language than I am. :)
